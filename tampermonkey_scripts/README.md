# TamperMonkey Scripts
These scripts are ready to be imported directly into TamperMonkey

### Required:
* Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
* TamperMonkey (browser addon) - https://www.tampermonkey.net/

### Full TamperMonkey Repo
You can find the rest of my TamperMonkey scripts here: https://greasyfork.org/en/users/705126-halt-i-m-reptar

### Installing TamperMonkey Scripts
With TamperMonkey installed, you can then add any of the plugins from our GreasyFork repo:

When you click on a script, for instance the TCG Player Sales Data Display, you will be presented with an option to re/install the script.

Once you click that button, you can verify that the script has been added by looking at your Installed Userscript Dashboard

You should see the new/updated script in the list of scripts you have added.

### Utilizing the TCG Player Sales Data Display
* Visit a TCG Player product page.
* You can verify the script was loaded by looking at the TamperMonkey browser icon.  
** _**Note:** If you do not see the script has loaded, refresh the page. TamperMonkey is great but not perfect and sometimes it cannot determine the namespace and match of a webpage; a simple refresh of the page will take care of that._
* Set your "Days to Look Back"
* Click on "Gather Sales Data"
